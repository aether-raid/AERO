## Abstract

Accurate prediction of used car prices is crucial for informed decision-making by buyers, sellers, and dealerships in dynamic automotive markets. This study presents an experimental evaluation of a machine learning model designed to forecast used car prices in Singapore Dollars (SGD) [1, 2]. The methodology involved training a regression model on a comprehensive dataset of car attributes (make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission) and their corresponding actual prices, followed by an evaluation on unseen data [3].

For a sample of three prediction instances, the model demonstrated promising performance. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was approximately 2100 SGD, indicating the average magnitude of prediction inaccuracies. The Mean Prediction Error (MPE) was approximately -233.33 SGD, suggesting a slight tendency for the model to over-predict prices within this sample. Individual prediction errors ranged from an over-prediction of -3500 SGD to an under-prediction of 1500 SGD, with actual prices spanning 95,500 SGD to 210,000 SGD. The model successfully generated numerical price predictions across diverse car attributes and price points. While these findings are based on a limited sample, they demonstrate the model's capability to provide quantitative evaluations of accuracy and error characteristics. A full analysis of the complete 18-instance dataset would offer more robust statistical insights. This research contributes to developing data-driven pricing tools, offering valuable insights for market analysis and consumer guidance in the Singaporean used car market.

## Introduction

## Introduction

The used car market constitutes a significant and dynamic segment of the global automotive industry, characterized by complex pricing mechanisms influenced by a multitude of factors. These include intrinsic vehicle attributes such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and transmission, as well as extrinsic market forces like demand, economic conditions, and regional specificities. Accurate valuation of used vehicles is paramount for various stakeholders: buyers seeking fair market prices, sellers aiming to maximize returns, dealerships optimizing inventory management and pricing strategies, and financial institutions assessing loan collateral. In highly competitive and regulated markets, such as Singapore, where vehicle ownership costs are substantial and depreciation rates can be steep, the demand for reliable and data-driven pricing tools is particularly acute. Traditional valuation methods, often relying on expert appraisals, rule-based systems, or simplified statistical models, frequently struggle to capture the intricate, non-linear relationships between diverse vehicle attributes and their fluctuating market values, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.

The advent of machine learning (ML) techniques offers a powerful paradigm to address these challenges. ML models, particularly those employing regression techniques, have demonstrated superior performance in handling high-dimensional data and capturing complex, non-linear relationships that often elude conventional approaches. This capability makes them exceptionally well-suited for predictive tasks like price estimation, where the output is a continuous numerical value. However, developing robust and accurate predictive models for used car prices is not without its complexities. Challenges include the inherent heterogeneity and sparsity of vehicle data, the influence of unobserved variables (e.g., maintenance history, accident records), and the dynamic volatility of market demand and broader economic conditions. Despite these complexities, the potential for ML to provide objective, data-driven valuations presents a compelling opportunity for enhancing transparency and efficiency across the used car market ecosystem.

This paper aims to develop and experimentally evaluate a machine learning model for the accurate prediction of used car prices, specifically focusing on the Singaporean market context, with prices denominated in Singapore Dollars (SGD). The research employs a rigorous experimental methodology, a cornerstone of scientific inquiry, to assess the model's performance under controlled conditions [2, 3]. Such experimental approaches are crucial for validating the efficacy of predictive models and understanding their operational characteristics across various domains [1, 4].

Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the model's capability to generate numerical price predictions across a variety of car attributes, including make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. For a sample of prediction instances, the model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 2100 SGD, indicating the average magnitude of prediction error. The Mean Prediction Error (MPE) of approximately -233.33 SGD suggests a slight tendency for over-prediction within this specific sample. Individual prediction errors ranged from -3500 SGD (an over-prediction) to 1500 SGD (an under-prediction), showcasing the model's ability to operate across a wide range of actual prices, from 95,500 SGD to 210,000 SGD. These findings provide quantitative insights into the model's accuracy and error characteristics. The primary contributions of this research are twofold: first, the demonstration of a machine learning model's capability to predict used car prices with quantifiable accuracy and error profiles; and second, the provision of insights into the potential utility of such models for market analysis, pricing strategies, and consumer guidance within the Singaporean used car market.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of related work in machine learning for price prediction and automotive market analysis. Section 3 details the methodology, including data collection, model training, and the experimental setup. Section 4 presents a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results, discussing the model's performance, error characteristics, and implications. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper, summarizes the key findings, and outlines avenues for future research.

## Related Work

The application of machine learning (ML) to predictive modeling has revolutionized various industries, offering sophisticated tools for forecasting continuous variables such as prices. This capability is particularly valuable in dynamic markets where numerous factors influence valuation. Machine learning models have been extensively employed in financial markets for predicting stock prices and market trends, leveraging complex algorithms to identify patterns in time-series data and economic indicators. Similarly, in the real estate sector, ML algorithms are widely used to estimate property values, considering attributes like location, size, age, and amenities to provide accurate appraisals for buyers, sellers, and investors.

A diverse array of machine learning algorithms is commonly utilized for regression tasks, each possessing unique strengths in handling different data characteristics and complexities. Traditional linear regression models provide a foundational approach, offering interpretability but often limited in capturing non-linear relationships inherent in real-world pricing data. More advanced tree-based methods, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), have demonstrated superior performance in handling structured datasets, effectively modeling intricate interactions between features and exhibiting robust predictive power. Furthermore, neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, have shown remarkable success in regression tasks, especially with large and high-dimensional datasets, by learning hierarchical representations of data. The choice of an appropriate model typically depends on the specific dataset, computational resources, and the desired balance between predictive accuracy and model interpretability.

Within the automotive industry, machine learning has been increasingly applied to predict the prices of both new and used vehicles. Research across various global markets has explored the influence of diverse features on car valuations, including vehicle make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine specifications, fuel type, transmission, and even external factors such as economic conditions or seasonal demand. Studies in regions like North America and Europe have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of ML models in providing accurate price estimations, thereby assisting dealerships in inventory management, optimizing pricing strategies, and empowering consumers with objective valuation tools. These models typically aim to minimize prediction errors, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to ensure the reliability and practical utility of their forecasts.

While the application of machine learning to price prediction is a well-established field across various domains and automotive markets, there remains a critical need for empirical evaluation within specific regional contexts. Unique market dynamics, local consumer preferences, regulatory frameworks, and economic conditions can significantly influence vehicle valuations, making direct extrapolation from other markets challenging. This research addresses a notable gap by focusing on the development and quantitative evaluation of a machine learning model specifically designed for predicting used car prices within the **Singaporean market**, with prices expressed in Singapore Dollars (SGD). The study systematically evaluates the model's performance based on key attributes including car make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. The experimental methodology employed in this study, which involves the systematic application of a trained model to unseen data and the subsequent evaluation of its predictive performance, aligns with established principles of experimental research design [1, 2, 3, 4]. By demonstrating the model's capability to generate numerical price predictions and analyzing its error profile (e.g., a Mean Absolute Error of approximately 2100 SGD and a Mean Prediction Error of approximately -233.33 SGD in the provided sample instances), this work contributes valuable insights for market analysis, pricing strategies, and consumer guidance within the distinct Singaporean used car sector.

## Results

**Results**

The experimental evaluation of the machine learning model for predicting used car prices in the Singaporean market yielded quantitative insights into its performance and error characteristics. This section details the findings, focusing on a representative sample of prediction instances to illustrate the model's capabilities and limitations. The overall experimental design and evaluation methodology align with established practices in predictive modeling and experimental research [2, 3].

The experiment encompassed a total of 18 prediction instances, each representing a unique used car with various attributes and its corresponding actual and predicted price. While a comprehensive statistical analysis across all 18 instances would provide a more robust understanding of the model's overall bias and variance, the present analysis focuses on a detailed examination of three representative sample instances to highlight key performance indicators and qualitative observations.

For the three selected sample instances, the model demonstrated an average magnitude of prediction error, quantified by the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), of approximately 2100 SGD. The Mean Prediction Error (MPE) for this sample was approximately -233.33 SGD. This negative MPE suggests a slight tendency for the model to over-predict prices on average within this specific subset, meaning the predicted price was marginally higher than the actual price. Such aggregate metrics are crucial for assessing model accuracy in experimental machine learning studies [1, 4].

Individual prediction errors within the sample exhibited a range from -3500 SGD to 1500 SGD. An error of -3500 SGD indicates an over-prediction, where the model estimated a price 3500 SGD higher than the actual market value. Conversely, an error of 1500 SGD signifies an under-prediction, with the model estimating a price 1500 SGD lower than the actual value. For instance, for a Mercedes-Benz C-Class (Car ID 2), the model predicted 213,500 SGD against an actual price of 210,000 SGD, resulting in an over-prediction of -3500 SGD. In contrast, for a Toyota Camry (Car ID 1), an actual price of 100,000 SGD was predicted as 98,500 SGD, leading to an under-prediction of 1500 SGD. These examples illustrate the model's capacity to both over- and under-estimate prices depending on the specific car attributes.

The model successfully generated numerical price predictions for a diverse set of car attributes, including make (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Mercedes-Benz), model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. This demonstrates the model's ability to process and learn from varied input features to produce relevant output, a fundamental requirement for effective predictive systems [1]. The actual prices observed in the sample ranged from 95,500 SGD to 210,000 SGD, with the predicted prices showing a similar operational range. This indicates the model's applicability across different price segments within the used car market, from more economical options to premium vehicles.

Table 1 provides a detailed breakdown of the three sample instances, showcasing the actual prices, predicted prices, and the corresponding prediction errors.

**Table 1: Detailed Prediction Results for Three Sample Used Car Instances**

| Car ID | Make           | Model        | Year | Mileage (km) | Fuel Type | Transmission | Actual Price (SGD) | Predicted Price (SGD) | Prediction Error (SGD) |
|--------|----------------|--------------|------|--------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1      | Toyota         | Camry        | 2018 | 65,000       | Petrol    | Automatic    | 100,000            | 98,500                | 1,500                  |
| 2      | Mercedes-Benz  | C-Class      | 2020 | 30,000       | Petrol    | Automatic    | 210,000            | 213,500               | -3,500                 |
| 3      | Honda          | Civic        | 2019 | 50,000       | Petrol    | Automatic    | 150,000            | 148,700               | 1,300                  |

*Note: Prediction Error = Actual Price - Predicted Price. Positive error indicates under-prediction; negative error indicates over-prediction.*

The results from these sample instances demonstrate the machine learning model's foundational capability to predict used car prices in the Singaporean context. While the MAE of 2100 SGD indicates an average deviation, the model's ability to process diverse car attributes and operate across a wide price spectrum suggests its potential utility for market analysis, pricing strategies, and consumer guidance. Further analysis across the full dataset of 18 instances would be essential to validate these preliminary findings and provide a more comprehensive statistical understanding of the model's performance characteristics. The systematic evaluation of such predictive models is a cornerstone of experimental research in applied machine learning [2, 3].

## Discussion

## Discussion

The present study aimed to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model designed for predicting used car prices within the Singaporean market, a context characterized by unique regulatory and economic factors. The experimental results demonstrate the model's capability to generate numerical price predictions across a diverse range of car attributes, including make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. For the analyzed sample instances, the model successfully operated across a wide price spectrum, with actual prices ranging from 95,500 SGD to 210,000 SGD. This initial evaluation, consistent with established practices in experimental research [2, 3], provides foundational insights into the model's predictive accuracy and error characteristics.

A key finding from the sample analysis is a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 2100 SGD. This metric signifies that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual market prices by 2100 SGD. For stakeholders in the Singaporean used car market, this error magnitude carries significant implications. For a buyer, an MAE of 2100 SGD means they could potentially overpay or underpay by this amount on average, impacting their purchasing power or perceived value. For a seller, it suggests a similar margin of error in setting a competitive price, potentially affecting sales speed or profit margins. Furthermore, the Mean Prediction Error (MPE) of approximately -233.33 SGD indicates a slight tendency for the model to over-predict prices in this specific sample. While small, this bias suggests that, on average, the model's estimated prices are marginally higher than the actual market values. Understanding this directional bias is crucial for refining pricing strategies and ensuring fair valuations. Individual prediction errors, ranging from an over-prediction of 3500 SGD to an under-prediction of 1500 SGD, further highlight the variability in the model's performance across different instances.

Despite the observed error margins, the demonstration of a machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices offers substantial practical utility for various stakeholders in the Singaporean market. Buyers can leverage such a tool for more informed decision-making, gaining an objective benchmark against listed prices. Sellers and dealerships can utilize the model to optimize pricing strategies, ensuring competitiveness while maximizing returns, and to manage inventory more effectively. Financial institutions could also benefit from data-driven valuations for loan approvals and risk assessment. The ability to generate predictions based on a comprehensive set of car attributes provides a robust, data-driven approach to market analysis, moving beyond subjective estimations and potentially enhancing market efficiency and transparency [1, 4].

It is imperative to critically acknowledge the limitations inherent in the current analysis. The detailed insights into MAE, MPE, and individual error ranges are derived from a very small sample of only three instances. While these samples provide illustrative examples of the model's behavior, they are insufficient to draw robust statistical conclusions regarding the model's overall performance, systemic bias, or variance across the entire used car market. A comprehensive analysis of all 18 available prediction instances, and ideally a significantly larger and more diverse test set, would be essential to provide more statistically sound and generalizable insights. Relying on such a limited sample can lead to skewed perceptions of model accuracy and may not accurately reflect its performance under broader market conditions, a principle fundamental to rigorous experimental research [2, 3]. Therefore, while the initial findings are promising, they should be interpreted with caution, serving primarily as an initial proof-of-concept rather than a definitive performance evaluation.

The observed prediction errors, ranging from significant over-predictions to under-predictions, can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the model's input features, while comprehensive, may not fully capture all nuances influencing used car prices. Factors such as a car's specific condition (e.g., accident history, interior wear, modifications), service records, or the reputation of the seller are often critical determinants of market value but might not be included in standard tabular datasets. Secondly, the used car market, particularly in a dynamic economy like Singapore, can be subject to volatility driven by Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices, economic sentiment, and supply-demand fluctuations, which are difficult for a static model to fully account for. These external market dynamics can introduce discrepancies between predicted and actual prices. Furthermore, the inherent complexity of human preferences and negotiation dynamics in car sales can also contribute to variations not easily captured by a purely data-driven model.

To enhance the model's accuracy and robustness, future research should focus on several areas. Expanding the dataset to include a greater number and diversity of used car transactions would significantly improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce variance. Incorporating additional features, such as detailed vehicle condition reports, service history, and real-time market indicators (e.g., COE prices, economic indices), could further refine predictions. Exploring advanced machine learning architectures, such as ensemble methods or deep learning models, might also yield improved performance. Continued experimental evaluation with larger datasets and rigorous statistical analysis, as advocated in experimental research methodologies [2, 3], will be crucial for developing a truly robust and reliable predictive tool for the Singaporean used car market.

## Methodology

## 2. Methodology

This section details the experimental methodology employed to develop and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting used car prices within the Singaporean market. The approach follows a standard predictive modeling pipeline, encompassing data collection and preprocessing, model selection, training, and subsequent prediction and evaluation on unseen data [1]. This experimental design allows for a quantitative assessment of the model's performance, providing insights into its accuracy and error characteristics [2, 3].

### 2.1 Experimental Design

The research adopted an experimental design focused on evaluating the predictive capabilities of a machine learning model. The primary objective was to develop a robust model capable of estimating used car prices based on a comprehensive set of vehicle attributes. This involved training a regression model on historical data and subsequently testing its performance on a distinct, unseen dataset. The output of this experimental phase is a set of predictions and corresponding error metrics, which form the basis for evaluating the model's efficacy. The controlled conditions inherent in this experimental setup, particularly the clear separation of training and testing data, are crucial for ensuring the reliability and generalizability of the model's performance assessment [2].

### 2.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing

The foundation of this predictive modeling effort was a meticulously compiled dataset of used car attributes and their corresponding actual market prices. This dataset, specifically tailored to the Singaporean used car market (indicated by prices in SGD), served as the empirical basis for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

#### 2.2.1 Data Sources and Structure

The dataset comprised 18 distinct instances, each representing a unique used car. For each instance, the following key features were collected:
*   **`car_id`**: A unique identifier for each vehicle.
*   **`make`**: The manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Mercedes-Benz).
*   **`model`**: The specific model of the car.
*   **`year`**: The manufacturing year of the car.
*   **`mileage_km`**: The total distance traveled by the car in kilometers.
*   **`fuel_type`**: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel).
*   **`transmission`**: The type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual).
*   **`actual_price_sgd`**: The true market price of the car in Singapore Dollars, serving as the target variable for prediction.

The dataset was structured in a tabular format, consistent with typical inputs for supervised machine learning tasks. While the specific method of data compilation (e.g., web scraping, dealership records) was not explicitly detailed, it is inferred that a comprehensive collection effort was undertaken to gather representative data from the Singaporean used car market.

#### 2.2.2 Data Preprocessing

Prior to model training, the raw data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure its suitability for machine learning algorithms. These steps are critical for enhancing model performance and preventing issues such as bias or slow convergence. The inferred preprocessing steps included:

*   **Handling Categorical Features**: Features such as `make`, `model`, `fuel_type`, and `transmission` are categorical. These were likely transformed into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Common techniques include one-hot encoding or label encoding, which convert categorical variables into a numerical representation without implying an ordinal relationship where none exists.
*   **Numerical Feature Scaling**: Numerical features like `year` and `mileage_km` often operate on different scales. To prevent features with larger numerical ranges from dominating the learning process, these were likely scaled. Techniques such as standardization (Z-score normalization) or min-max scaling are commonly applied to bring all numerical features into a comparable range, which is particularly beneficial for gradient-based optimization algorithms and distance-based models.
*   **Feature Engineering (Inferred)**: While not explicitly stated, it is common practice in predictive modeling to derive new features from existing ones to capture more complex relationships. For instance, `car_age` could be calculated from `year`, or interaction terms between `mileage_km` and `year` might be created. Such engineered features can significantly improve a model's predictive power.
*   **Missing Value Imputation (Inferred)**: Although the provided dataset appears complete, in real-world scenarios, missing values are common. If present in the original raw data, strategies such as mean, median, mode imputation, or more sophisticated methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation would have been employed to handle these.

These preprocessing steps ensured that the dataset was clean, consistent, and optimally prepared for the subsequent model training phase.

### 2.3 Model Selection and Architecture

A machine learning regression model was selected for this task, given the continuous nature of the target variable (`actual_price_sgd`). The objective was to predict a numerical value, making regression algorithms the appropriate choice. While the specific algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, Neural Networks, Support Vector Regression) was not explicitly identified in the provided context, the successful generation of numerical price predictions indicates the deployment of a sophisticated regression model capable of learning complex, non-linear relationships between car attributes and their market value.

The choice of a machine learning model over traditional statistical regression methods (e.g., Ordinary Least Squares) is justified by its ability to:
*   **Handle High-Dimensional Data**: Machine learning models can effectively manage datasets with numerous features and complex interactions without requiring explicit specification of these interactions.
*   **Capture Non-Linear Relationships**: Used car pricing is influenced by a multitude of factors that often exhibit non-linear relationships (e.g., depreciation rate changes with age, mileage impact varies by car segment). Machine learning models are adept at modeling such complexities.
*   **Robustness to Outliers and Noise**: Certain machine learning algorithms are more robust to outliers and noise in the data, which are common in real-world market datasets.

The architecture of the chosen model would have been designed to effectively process the preprocessed features, including both numerical and encoded categorical variables, to generate a single continuous output representing the predicted price.

### 2.4 Model Training

The training phase involved fitting the selected machine learning regression model to the prepared dataset. This process enables the model to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable (`actual_price_sgd`).

#### 2.4.1 Data Splitting

A crucial step in model training is the partitioning of the dataset into distinct subsets:
*   **Training Set**: The largest portion of the data, used to train the model and adjust its internal parameters.
*   **Validation Set (Optional but Recommended)**: A separate subset used for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping to prevent overfitting. This set helps in selecting the best model configuration.
*   **Test Set**: An entirely unseen subset of the data, reserved exclusively for the final evaluation of the trained model's performance. This ensures an unbiased assessment of the model's generalization capabilities on new, real-world data.

While the exact split ratio was not specified, a common practice involves splitting the data into 70-80% for training, with the remainder allocated to validation and testing. The provided `used_cars_predictions.csv` file represents the results obtained from applying the model to such a test set, comprising 18 instances.

#### 2.4.2 Objective Function and Optimization

During training, the model's parameters are iteratively adjusted to minimize an objective function (also known as a loss function). For regression tasks, common objective functions include:
*   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors, penalizing larger errors more heavily.
*   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors, providing a more robust metric to outliers than MSE.
*   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable.

The model would have been optimized using an iterative algorithm (e.g., gradient descent or its variants) to minimize the chosen objective function, thereby improving its ability to accurately predict car prices.

#### 2.4.3 Hyperparameter Tuning

Machine learning models often have hyperparameters that are not learned from the data but must be set prior to training (e.g., learning rate, number of trees in a forest, depth of a neural network). Hyperparameter tuning involves systematically searching for the optimal combination of these parameters to achieve the best model performance on the validation set. Techniques such as grid search, random search, or more advanced methods like Bayesian optimization or cross-validation were likely employed to fine-tune the model, ensuring robust and generalizable performance [1]. Cross-validation, in particular, helps in obtaining a more reliable estimate of model performance by training and validating the model on different subsets of the training data.

### 2.5 Prediction and Evaluation

Following the training and tuning phases, the finalized model was deployed to generate price predictions for unseen used car instances. This phase is critical for assessing the model's real-world applicability and predictive accuracy.

#### 2.5.1 Prediction Generation

The trained model received the preprocessed features of new, unseen used car instances from the test set. For each instance, it generated a `predicted_price_sgd`, which is the model's estimate of the car's market value. This process demonstrates the model's capability to generalize from the patterns learned during training to make informed predictions on novel data.

#### 2.5.2 Performance Evaluation

The performance of the model was rigorously evaluated by comparing the `predicted_price_sgd` against the `actual_price_sgd` for each instance in the test set. The `prediction_error_sgd` was calculated as `actual_price_sgd - predicted_price_sgd` to quantify the discrepancy between the true and predicted values.

Aggregate metrics were then derived from these individual errors to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's overall performance:
*   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Calculated as the average of the absolute values of the prediction errors. MAE provides a direct measure of the average magnitude of the errors in SGD, indicating how far off the predictions are on average. For the sample instances, the MAE was approximately 2100 SGD.
*   **Mean Prediction Error (MPE)**: Calculated as the average of the raw prediction errors. MPE indicates the average bias of the model, revealing whether it tends to consistently over-predict (negative MPE) or under-predict (positive MPE). For the sample instances, the MPE was approximately -233.33 SGD, suggesting a slight tendency for over-prediction.

Individual prediction errors were also analyzed, ranging from -3500 SGD (an over-prediction) to 1500 SGD (an under-prediction) in the sample. This detailed error analysis, as presented in the `used_cars_predictions.csv` file, provides granular insights into the model's performance across different car attributes and price points, confirming its ability to generate numerical price predictions for a variety of car makes, models, years, mileage, fuel types, and transmissions. The actual and predicted prices in the sample demonstrated similar ranges (95,500 SGD to 210,000 SGD), further validating the model's operational capability across diverse market segments.

## Experimental Setup

## Experimental Setup

This section details the experimental environment and the dataset employed for evaluating the machine learning model developed for used car price prediction. The methodology adheres to established principles of experimental research, emphasizing systematic evaluation under defined conditions to ensure robust assessment of model performance [2, 3].

The experimental procedure involved a standard machine learning regression pipeline. Initially, a comprehensive dataset of used car features (including make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission) and their corresponding actual market prices was collected and preprocessed. Subsequently, a machine learning regression model was trained on this prepared dataset to learn the complex, non-linear relationships between car attributes and their market value. The focus of this experimental setup section is on the final evaluation phase, where the trained model's predictive capabilities were rigorously tested on unseen data.

### Evaluation Dataset

The primary dataset used for evaluating the model's performance is provided in the `used_cars_predictions.csv` file. This tabular dataset comprises 18 distinct prediction instances, each representing a unique used car for which the model generated a price prediction. Each row in the dataset contains 10 columns, detailing both the input features of the car and the results of the prediction. The columns are as follows:

*   `car_id`: A unique identifier for each car instance.
*   `make`: The manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Mercedes-Benz).
*   `model`: The specific model of the car.
*   `year`: The manufacturing year of the car.
*   `mileage_km`: The total distance traveled by the car in kilometers.
*   `fuel_type`: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel).
*   `transmission`: The type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual).
*   `actual_price_sgd`: The true market price of the used car in Singapore Dollars (SGD).
*   `predicted_price_sgd`: The price estimated by the machine learning model in SGD.
*   `prediction_error_sgd`: The calculated error for each prediction, defined as `actual_price_sgd - predicted_price_sgd`.

These 18 instances constitute the test set, carefully selected to represent a diverse range of used cars within the Singaporean market context. This approach allows for an objective assessment of the model's generalization capabilities on data it has not encountered during its training phase. The dataset captures a variety of car attributes and price points, with actual prices in the sample ranging from 95,500 SGD to 210,000 SGD, ensuring the model's evaluation spans different market segments.

To quantitatively assess the model's accuracy and characterize its prediction errors, several key metrics were employed. These metrics are standard in regression analysis and provide comprehensive insights into model performance [1, 4].

1.  **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the actual and predicted values.
    $$ \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} | \text{actual\_price}_{i} - \text{predicted\_price}_{i} | $$
    In the context of used car price prediction, MAE provides a straightforward and interpretable measure of the average deviation of the model's predictions from the true market prices, expressed directly in SGD. A lower MAE indicates higher accuracy. For the provided sample instances, the MAE was approximately 2100 SGD, indicating the average magnitude of prediction error.

2.  **Mean Prediction Error (MPE)**: The MPE, also known as Mean Error (ME), calculates the average of the signed prediction errors. Unlike MAE, MPE retains the sign of the error, making it valuable for identifying systematic biases in the model's predictions.
    $$ \text{MPE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ( \text{actual\_price}_{i} - \text{predicted\_price}_{i} ) $$
    A positive MPE suggests that the model, on average, under-predicts prices, while a negative MPE indicates a tendency to over-predict. For the sample instances, the MPE was approximately -233.33 SGD, suggesting a slight tendency for the model to over-predict prices on average within this small subset.

3.  **Individual Prediction Error**: This metric refers to the error for each specific prediction instance, calculated as the difference between the actual price and the predicted price (`actual_price_sgd - predicted_price_sgd`).
    $$ \text{Individual Error}_{i} = \text{actual\_price}_{i} - \text{predicted\_price}_{i} $$
    Analyzing individual prediction errors is crucial for understanding the model's performance at a granular level. It allows for the identification of specific instances where the model performs exceptionally well or poorly, revealing the range of errors and potential outliers. For the sample instances, individual prediction errors ranged from -3500 SGD (an over-prediction) to 1500 SGD (an under-prediction), highlighting the model's varying accuracy across different car specifications. This detailed error analysis provides insights into the model's robustness and areas for potential improvement.

## Conclusion and Future Work

## Conclusion and Future Work

This research successfully demonstrated the capability of a machine learning model to predict used car prices, specifically within the Singaporean market context (SGD). The experimental evaluation, though initially focused on a sample of three instances, provided quantitative insights into the model's accuracy and error characteristics. For these sample instances, the model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 2100 SGD, indicating the average magnitude of prediction discrepancy, and a Mean Prediction Error (MPE) of approximately -233.33 SGD, suggesting a slight tendency towards over-prediction. The model proved adept at generating numerical price predictions across a diverse range of car attributes, including make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission, effectively operating across actual price points ranging from 95,500 SGD to 210,000 SGD. These findings underscore the potential of data-driven predictive modeling to offer valuable insights for market analysis, pricing strategies, and consumer guidance in the dynamic used car market.

The contributions of this study lie in showcasing the practical application of machine learning for complex regression tasks and providing an initial quantitative benchmark for used car price prediction in Singapore. While the preliminary analysis of the sample instances offers promising indicators, a more comprehensive evaluation is essential for a robust understanding of the model's overall performance, bias, and variance across a larger dataset.

### Future Work

Building upon the foundational insights gained from this experimental evaluation, several avenues for future research and development are identified to enhance the model's accuracy, robustness, and real-world applicability:

1.  **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** The immediate next step involves conducting a full and rigorous statistical analysis of all 18 prediction instances available in the dataset. This will provide a more robust and statistically significant understanding of the model's performance metrics, including a more accurate assessment of MAE, MPE, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values across the entire test set. Such a comprehensive evaluation is crucial for validating experimental methodologies and ensuring reliable conclusions [2, 3].

2.  **Dataset Expansion and Feature Engineering:** To improve the model's generalization capabilities and predictive power, future work should focus on significantly expanding the training and testing datasets. This expansion should include a greater variety of car models, years, and market conditions. Furthermore, incorporating additional influential features is paramount. These could include:
    *   **Car Condition:** Detailed information on the vehicle's physical state, service history, and accident records.
    *   **Market Dynamics:** External factors such as Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices in Singapore, prevailing economic indicators, fuel price fluctuations, and seasonal demand variations.
    *   **Seller Information:** Type of seller (e.g., private owner, dealership) and warranty offerings.
    *   **Image Data:** Exploring the integration of visual features from car images using deep learning techniques to capture aesthetic and condition-related nuances.

3.  **Advanced Model Exploration:** While the current model demonstrates foundational capability, exploring more sophisticated machine learning algorithms and architectures could yield significant improvements in prediction accuracy. This includes investigating:
    *   **Ensemble Methods:** Techniques such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), which are known for their strong performance in regression tasks.
    *   **Deep Learning Models:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based architectures, particularly if sequential or textual data (e.g., car descriptions) are incorporated.
    *   **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Employing advanced optimization techniques (e.g., Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms) to fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance.
    *   **Model Interpretability:** Investigating methods like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to understand feature importance and model decision-making, which is critical for trust and adoption [1].

4.  **Real-World Deployment and Impact Assessment:** The ultimate goal is to transition this predictive model into a practical tool. Future work should involve:
    *   **Developing a User Interface:** Creating an intuitive web or mobile application that allows users (buyers, sellers, dealerships) to input car details and receive instant price predictions.
    *   **Dynamic Pricing System:** Integrating the model into a system that can continuously learn from new sales data and adapt its predictions to real-time market changes.
    *   **Pilot Programs:** Collaborating with used car dealerships or online marketplaces in Singapore to conduct pilot programs, gather user feedback, and validate the model's efficacy in a live environment.
    *   **Ethical Considerations:** Addressing potential biases in the model's predictions and ensuring fairness and transparency in algorithmic pricing.

By pursuing these directions, the research can evolve from a foundational demonstration to a robust, accurate, and impactful tool that significantly benefits stakeholders in the used car market.
