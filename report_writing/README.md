## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from paper_writing_nodes import write_paper

# Simple paper generation
result = await write_paper(
    user_query="Write a paper about deep learning optimization techniques",
    target_venue="ICML"
)

# With experimental data
result = await write_paper(
    user_query="Analysis of machine learning model performance",
    experimental_data={"accuracy": 0.95, "f1_score": 0.92},
    uploaded_data=["[CSV: results.csv]\nmodel,accuracy,f1_score\nNN,0.95,0.92"]
)

# With file inputs
result = await write_paper(
    user_query="Research paper on my experimental results",
    file_paths=["experiments/results.csv", "data/analysis.xlsx"]
)
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Basic paper generation
python paper_writing_nodes.py "Your research topic"

# With data files
python paper_writing_nodes.py "Deep learning for climate prediction" data.csv

# Multiple files
python paper_writing_nodes.py "ML model comparison study" results.csv analysis.xlsx
```

## 📋 Workflow Architecture

The paper writing workflow consists of 6 optimized nodes:

```
📊 analyze_results → 🏗️ setup_paper → 🔍 find_sources → ✍️ generate_content → 🔍 critique_paper → 🎯 finalize_paper
```

### Node Details

1. **📊 Analyze Results** (`_analyze_results_node`)
   - Processes experimental data and uploaded files
   - Extracts key findings and research context
   - Prepares data for structure generation

2. **🏗️ Setup Paper** (`_setup_paper_node`)
   - Generates custom paper structure using LLM
   - Creates section-specific requirements and guidelines
   - Optimizes structure for single-call generation

3. **🔍 Find Sources** (`_find_supporting_sources_node`)
   - Performs targeted Tavily web searches
   - Finds relevant academic sources and citations
   - Categorizes sources by paper sections

4. **✍️ Generate Content** (`_generate_content_node`)
   - Produces complete paper in single comprehensive LLM call
   - Integrates citations naturally throughout all sections
   - Maintains coherent narrative flow across sections

5. **🔍 Critique Paper** (`_critique_paper_node`)
   - Evaluates paper quality across multiple dimensions
   - Identifies major issues and improvement opportunities
   - Provides detailed feedback for refinement

6. **🎯 Finalize Paper** (`_finalize_paper_node`)
   - Saves final paper to markdown file
   - Generates comprehensive metrics and statistics
   - Creates paper metadata and summary

## 📊 Output Examples

- **Quality Scores**: 6.5-8.5/10 from built-in critique system
- **Section Count**: 8-12 sections based on research topic

### Generated Files
- **📄 Main Paper**: `generated_paper_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`
- **📊 Paper Statistics**: Length, citations, sections, quality scores
- **🔍 Search Metadata**: Queries used, sources found, coverage metrics

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

# Optional
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4  # Default model for paper generation
```

### Supported Input Formats
- **📄 Text Files**: `.txt`, `.md`
- **📊 Data Files**: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.json`
- **📋 Document Files**: `.docx`, `.pdf` (with appropriate libraries)
- **🔢 Experimental Data**: Python dictionaries with metrics

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Structure Generation

```python
# Force specific venue formatting
result = await write_paper(
    user_query="Your research topic",
    target_venue="NeurIPS"  # Optimizes for specific conference
)

# With detailed experimental context
experimental_data = {
    "models_tested": ["CNN", "LSTM", "Transformer"],
    "best_accuracy": 0.94,
    "dataset_size": 10000,
    "training_time": "2 hours"
}

result = await write_paper(
    user_query="Comparative analysis of deep learning architectures",
    experimental_data=experimental_data

```

### Critique System Integration

The built-in critique system evaluates:
- **📝 Writing Quality**: Clarity, flow, academic tone
- **🔬 Technical Content**: Methodology, reproducibility, rigor
- **📚 Citation Quality**: Source credibility, integration, coverage

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    result = await write_paper("Your topic")
    if result.get("errors"):
        print("Issues encountered:", result["errors"])
    else:
        print("Paper generated successfully!")
        print(f"Saved to: {result['final_outputs']['paper_file']}")

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**JSON Parsing Errors**
```
⚠️ JSON parsing failed, using enhanced fallback structure
```
- **Solution**: The system automatically uses robust fallback structures
- **Prevention**: Ensure stable OpenAI API connection

**Citation Integration Issues**
```
📚 Citations integrated: 5/15 (33.3%)
```
- **Solution**: Check Tavily API key and internet connection
- **Mitigation**: System generates papers even with limited citations

**Memory/Token Limits**
```
❌ Content generation error: Token limit exceeded
```
- **Solution**: System automatically truncates context while preserving quality
- **Prevention**: Use more focused research queries

### Debug Information

Enable detailed logging by setting:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
